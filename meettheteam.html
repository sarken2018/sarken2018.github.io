              <h2>May Hathaway</h2>
            <p>Hello, I’m May, and I’m so honored to be a part of the Sarken campaign! Neil and Sarai are both such incredible people, both in terms of academic achievements and personality, and I believe that they would be wonderful leaders of Sophomore Caucus. They both have strong work ethics, and are always willing to help out a friend in need. Our student body need hard-working leaders who will take our opinions to heart, and there is no one better suited to the task. I am so proud to be a campaign manager for the Sarken campaign. I am a member of the cross country team and the track team, and I have also played tennis for nearly ten years. Additionally, I am an avid swimmer and flutist as well as a member of the Spectator’s Copy department and president of the upcoming Stuyvesant Mixed Race Student Coalition. I can say without a doubt that Neil and Sarai are the best people to represent a student body as diverse as ours, and I trust that they will represent all of our interests. </p>

              <h2>Miranda Lepri</h2>
            <p>Hi, I’m Miranda, and I’m really excited to announce that I’m a part of the Sarken 2018 campaign! From the moment I heard about Neil and Sarai’s campaign, I knew it was something I wanted to be a part of. Both of them are so dedicated in every facet of their lives, and are so supportive of and open to everyone they meet, and I firmly believe that it’s qualities like this that are so key in leadership. As for myself, I’m a dedicated debater on the Stuy Public Forum team, a writer for the A&E and Opinions departments of the Spectator, so I have a lot of experience with engaging in discourse, and I’ve learned how to listen and absorb other people’s opinions, as well as fight for my own. I also play the piano and upright bass, and I’m a sketch artist in my free time. I have total faith in this campaign, and in Neil and Sarai, to advocate and fight for what the student body wants and needs, and serve the sophomore class. </p>

              <h2>Anne Rhee</h2>
            <p>Hi, I’m Anne, a proud member of the Sarken ‘18 team! When I first came to Stuy, I immediately saw the importance of representing a student body with such diverse interests. Stuy is usually defined as a STEM-oriented school, but also makes it possible for people with interest in the humanities like me to be captivated with the Stuy lifestyle. For example, I am an avid policy debater, as well as a writer for the Spectator’s Opinions department. I’ve also been a violinist for almost eleven years and play in the school’s orchestra. Neil and Sarai are two of the most genuine and caring people I know, as well as passionate about helping others and forging connections. These qualities are what I believe define true and successful leaders, and I believe they are fully competent of representing the student body’s best and diverse interests and needs.</p>

              <h2>Chloe Terestchenko</h2>
            <p>Hi, I’m Chloe! I’m delighted to be a member of the Sarken 2018 campaign. Both Neil and Sarai are extremely dedicated, smart, and diverse, in both their studies and extracurriculars, and will accomplish a strong student government for our diverse grade. I’m extremely honored to be a campaign manager, and as well as being a committed student, I play various sports. I am currently on the track team and I am a competitive equestrian. I’ve been competing for nine years and travel around the country for the sport. Additionally, I have recently taken up scuba diving outside of school. At a school as large as Stuyvesant, it is important to have people like Sarai and Neil, who are so eager, caring, and hard-working, to create change and include everyone’s needs. Undoubtedly, they are the best team to represent the rising Sophomore student body.</p>
