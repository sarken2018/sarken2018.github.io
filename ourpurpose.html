        <p>Hi!
We, Neil Sarkar and Sarai Pridgen, are running for Sophomore Caucus. We’re dedicated individuals with a passion for improving the Stuyvesant community in any way we can, and look to advocate for each and every rising sophomore. We are running because we truly care and can best represent our grade. Our platform concentrates on outreach and action. We have specific policy ideas laid out that will enhance communication between our grade and enable us to take action. Our qualifications are a testament to our hard work and level of dedication. Both of us are avid debaters, have a history in student government, engage frequently with our community and commit to various extracurriculars. We hope to be a part of Stuyvesant’s future by leading the sophomore caucus. Let us know if you have any questions!

        <center><h2>Our Ideas</h2>
        <div class = 'idea'>One of our main goals is to increase interaction and outreach between the elected officials and the constituents. We want everyone to contribute to helping make Stuyvesant better. Thus, we propose online forms where everyone is invited to talk about changes that need to be made at our school. These forms would provide an easy, direct means of communication with the Sophomore Caucus that would allow the voices of students to be heard. Our objective is to accurately represent the ideas of our grade, and thus be able to take action. Students would be able to discuss events, activities, announcements, plans, and any other important issue. From this we can gain valuable insight on what each voice in the community and wants and can ensure that we represent everyone. </div>
        <div class = 'idea'>Following up with our first policy idea, we want to institute a new methods of communication to help the sophomore class. In order to maintain the most transparency and the best relationship with the student body, we plan on sending out notes on every sophomore caucus meeting to detail our progress, as well as update the student body regularly if any changes occur in our branch of government so students are aware of who is representing them at all times. We would also create a poll system that would regularly check in with the sophomore grade and see what we as a student government can do to satisfy your needs.</div>
        <div class = 'idea'> In order to increase unity in our grade and provide respite from our busy schedules, our sophomore caucus would push to have our semi-formal dance outside of Stuyvesant, and as a whole encourage more dances throughout the year so that we can all enjoy spending some of our free time together as a grade.</div>
