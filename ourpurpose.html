        <p>Hi!
We, Neil Sarkar and Sarai Pridgen, are running for Sophomore Caucus. We’re dedicated individuals with a passion for improving the Stuyvesant community in any way we can, and look to advocate for each and every rising sophomore. We are running because we truly care and can best represent our grade. Our platform concentrates on outreach and action. We have specific policy ideas laid out that will enhance communication between our grade and enable us to take action. Our qualifications are a testament to our hard work and level of dedication. Both of us are avid debaters, have a history in student government, engage frequently with our community and commit to various extracurriculars. We hope to be a part of Stuyvesant’s future by leading the sophomore caucus. Let us know if you have any questions!

            <p>One of our main goals is to increase interaction and outreach between the elected officials and the constituents. We want everyone to contribute to helping make Stuyvesant better. Thus, we propose community meetings where everyone is invited to talk about changes that need to be made at our school. We want to represent each and every idea that our grade wants and then take action. This is how it would work. Every other Tuesday, we would book a room and invite all to come. At every meeting, either Sarai or I would be present and we would be able to discuss events, activities, announcements, plans, and any other important issue. From this we can gain valuable insight on what each voice in the community and wants and can ensure that we represent everyone. </p>

          <div class = 'p-2'>
            <p>Following up with our first policy idea, we want to institute homeroom representatives. A homeroom representatives duty would include listening to his/her homeroom and contributing their ideas, suggestions, and concerns to us at monthly meetings. This is important because in our large school, good ideas can get neglected. Our goal is to take action and to represent all of us. Homeroom representatives can provide leadership and act as a way to disseminate information about Sophomore Caucus events. Sarai and I want to take into account everyone’s ideas because the only way to make Stuyvesant a better place is to work together and build off of each other. </p>
