              <p>Hi, I’m Neil! I am a determined, hardworking, and empathetic leader. At Stuy, I’m a part of the Speech and Debate Team (Public Forum) and just joined the News department of the Spectator. I love playing basketball and run a blog in my free time. In middle school, I was an active part our the school community and was elected to the student council for 3 years and was a part of the Manhattan Student Leadership Council. I also ran a fundraising drive that donated money to the International Rescue Committee which is dedicated to helping refugees. Sarai and I met at the debate interest meeting and I immediately noticed her caring and bubbly personality. We are running because we truly care and can best represent our grade. Our platform outlines specific steps that we will take to make our school a better place. Stuy is an amazing school but we can all agree that there are some important changes that need to be made. Sarai and I will represent each and everyone one of you and we hope that you will support us in making Stuy even better. We hope to be a part of Stuyvesant’s future by leading the sophomore caucus. </p>

              Hi, I’m Sarai, and I’m running for Sophomore Caucus with Neil Sarkar. Neil and I are committed to promoting transparency and accessibility in the caucus for all students, politically active and otherwise. We aim to mold the Sophomore Caucus into an entity that advocates for the entirety of the sophomore class, and maintain clarity and outreach beyond our campaign. We are committed to making communication with the student body easy and available. Neil and I are are both avid debaters as well as former student government officials, and our dynamic on and off the campaign makes us the perfect candidates to promote amicable communication. We’re both excited to advocate for the sophomore class, not just as a delivery of our campaign promises, but as a continuation of our commitment to outreach and communication as a whole.</p>
